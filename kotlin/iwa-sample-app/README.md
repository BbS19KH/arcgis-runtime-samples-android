This sample app shows how to use a custom authentication challenge handler to work with IWA portals. 

 1. Enter url of the portal you want to connect to in the edit text box. The url of a default test portal has
 been set.
 2. Tap on the "Sign In" button to connect to the portal as a named user. A dialog will be popped up for
 username/password. When a correct credential is passed, the portal will be loaded. If you keep passing in
 wrong credential, no more prompt for credential will occur after the default number of attempts.
 The portal will fail to load. You can click the "Cancel" button to cancel the sign-in
 process. Portal will fail to load with a different error message.
